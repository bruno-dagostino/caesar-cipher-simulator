# caesar-cipher-simulator
This caesar-cipher-simulator project is an educational tool which simulates the workings of a Caesar Cipher, named after Julius Caesar, who used it with a shift of three to protect messages of military significance. The software allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages. Additionally, the simulation includes a step-by-step guide that teaches users how to recover the Caesar Cipher keys.

This project was created and maintained by Bruno D'Agostino.
